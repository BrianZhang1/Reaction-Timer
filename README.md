# About

A small reaction timer that was at first for a school project, but I decided to continue working on it recently.
Was my first experience with Flask, SQL, and backend/frontend development.  
Hosted at [brianz1alt.pythonanywhere.com](https://brianz1alt.pythonanywhere.com/).  
Feel free to give it a try, it's definitely still a work-in-progress.  
Thanks to PythonAnywhere too, it's a cool free web hosting site.
