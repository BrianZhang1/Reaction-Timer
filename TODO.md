# To-Do List

## Major Plans

- implement profile page with change password and shows profile info
- view page big change plan
    - view page sort by top times, most recent
    - view page search bar, search for users
    - view page allow delete only if logged in as target post's user
- when logged out, after test and redirect to login page, save results after logging in.
- navbar button animations onhover (underline growth, change color)

## Fixes/Minor Changes

- Make styles in css use ID when appropriate
- onkeydown -> event listeners
- change redirect form JS (different way to send a simple GET request from JS)
- revise all redirect/render_template to see if it is fitting
- "too early" in test, display "too early"
- users can only delete their own times
- create margin for view page, make it look decent
- login instead/return to home for register page
- navbar for register, login, and logout page
- change all session[] to session.get()

## Maybe Implement?

- seperate results and test page
- make everything pretty
